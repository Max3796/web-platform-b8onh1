    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h4>My name is Gurpreet Singh Ghuman and I am a Kalvium student studying in Lovely Professional University. I have many hobbies, but the ones I enjoy the most are playing guitar and playing basketball and badminton. Playing guitar helps me express myself and relax after a long day of studying. I like to learn new songs and practice different techniques. Playing basketball and badminton keeps me fit and healthy, and also allows me to have fun with my friends. I love the thrill of competing and improving my skills. These hobbies make me happy and enrich my life.</h4>
